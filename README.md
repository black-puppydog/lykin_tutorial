## Introduction

[lykin](https://git.coopcloud.tech/glyph/lykin) is a tutorial application funded by a Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) community grant. It is intended to showcase one way in which an SSB client application can be written using the [golgi](https://git.coopcloud.tech/golgi-ssb/golgi) client library. This tutorial series walks the reader through the creation of the lykin application.
